# Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains solutions for the Advent of Code (AOC) challenges in multiple programming languages. The solutions are organized by day and part.

## Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- Each programming language has its own directory at the root level of the project. Currently, solutions are provided in Python, JavaScript, and Java.
- Within each language directory, there are subdirectories for each day of the AOC challenges.
- Within each day directory, there are separate files for each part of the challenge.

For example, the Python solution for part 1 of day 1 is located at `AOC_solution/python/day1/part1.py`.

## Running the Solutions

To run a solution, navigate to the appropriate directory and run the file using the corresponding language's interpreter or compiler. For example, to run the Python solution for part 1 of day 1, you would do the following:

```bash
cd python/day1
python part1.py
```

Replace `python` and `.py` with the appropriate language and file extension for other solutions.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have a solution in a language that is not currently represented, feel free to add a new directory for that language and submit a pull request.
